The devtools are opening because of these lines in your code:

  src/window/windowManager.js:486: listen.webContents.openDevTools({ mode:
   'detach' });
  src/window/windowManager.js:519: ask.webContents.openDevTools({ mode: 
  'detach' });
  src/window/windowManager.js:554: settings.webContents.openDevTools({ 
  mode: 'detach' });
  src/window/windowManager.js:592:
  shortcutEditor.webContents.openDevTools({ mode: 'detach' });
  src/window/windowManager.js:727: header.webContents.openDevTools({ mode:
   'detach' });

  All are guarded by if (!app.isPackaged) so they only open in development
   mode when the app is not packaged.

> what is each window for? there are 5 total, by the way. 
  make sure each is accounted for

‚è∫ Looking at the window creation code, here are the 5 windows
   and their purposes:

  1. header (src/window/windowManager.js:650) - The main
  header/control bar window that's always visible and
  contains the primary UI controls
  2. listen (src/window/windowManager.js:460) - The
  listening/transcription window for audio capture and
  speech-to-text functionality
  3. ask (src/window/windowManager.js:494) - The AI
  chat/query window where users can ask questions and get
  responses
  4. settings (src/window/windowManager.js:527) - The
  settings/preferences window for configuring the application
  5. shortcut-settings (src/window/windowManager.js:560) - A
  dedicated window for managing keyboard shortcuts and hotkey
   configurations

  Each window loads the same base HTML file (content.html or
  header.html) but with different view parameters to render
  different interfaces. The devtools open for all 5 windows
  in development mode.
