  Summary of Changes

  1. Model Configuration Updates ✅

  Files Modified:
  - src/features/common/ai/factory.js: Updated OpenAI models from GPT-4.1 to GPT-4o
  - src/features/common/services/modelStateService.js: Added filter to hide Gemini from UI
  - src/ui/settings/SettingsView.js: Hidden Gemini from API key management UI

  Changes:
  - Default LLM models now use GPT-4o instead of GPT-4.1
  - Nova-3 remains the default STT option (already configured)
  - Gemini functionality preserved but hidden from user interface

  2. Listen Mode Default View ✅

  Files Modified:
  - src/ui/listen/ListenView.js: Changed viewMode default from 'insights' to 'transcript'

  Result: Listen mode now opens to transcript view by default

  3. Conversation Copy to Ask Window ✅

  Files Modified:

  Backend Integration:
  - src/features/listen/listenService.js:
    - Added formatSessionForAskWindow() method to format conversation transcript
    - Modified closeSession() to trigger conversation copy before session cleanup
    - Uses existing transcript repository to get chronological conversation data

  IPC Communication:
  - src/features/ask/askService.js:
    - Added populateInputWithText() method
    - Added internalBridge event handler for 'send-conversation-to-ask'
    - Shows Ask window and populates input field without auto-submitting

  Frontend Integration:
  - src/ui/ask/AskView.js:
    - Added populateInputField() method
    - Added IPC listener for 'populate-input' events

  - src/preload.js: Added API bridge for onPopulateInput

  Workflow Summary

  Listen Mode (now defaults to transcript)
      ↓
  User clicks "Stop"
      ↓
  listenService.closeSession()
      ↓
  formatSessionForAskWindow() extracts conversation
      ↓
  internalBridge.emit('send-conversation-to-ask')
      ↓
  askService.populateInputWithText()
      ↓
  Ask window shows with conversation text (not submitted)
      ↓
  User can edit and submit when ready

  Technical Implementation Notes

  - DRY Principle: Leveraged existing architecture patterns for IPC communication
  - Minimal Code: Used surgical changes rather than refactoring entire components
  - Error Handling: Added proper error handling in conversation formatting and IPC communication
  - User Experience: Conversation text populates input field but doesn't auto-submit, allowing user
  editing

  The implementation is complete and ready for testing. The conversation will now automatically copy to
  the Ask window when Listen mode is stopped, while maintaining the new default view behavior.
